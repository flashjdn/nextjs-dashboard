   <h3 id="title"> Who is Valkyrie? </h3>
<p>     
  Kairi Imahara, better known by the moniker <i>Valkyrie</i>, is a playable character in the critically acclaimed FPS battle royale Apex Legends. Valkyrie was introduced into the character roster on May 4th, 2021. The jaunty jetpack pilot skyrocketed to top of the popularity charts (pun intended) amongst the Apex fanbase and has managed to maintain a Top-5 pick rate since her release ‚Äì currently averaging ~8.6% amongst the game‚Äôs 12M players worldwide. </p>

<p>Some people would say that being able to fly a jetpack around is almost too much of an advantage. I say those people need to learn to be quiet. Go read a book or something ü•±.</p>

   <h3 id="title"> Additional information </h3>
   <ul>
     <li> As seen in the video above, Valkyrie is a Recon legend with a heavy focus on verticality and repositioning. </li>

<li> The ability to quickly blast off into the sky and redeploy with her squad is invaluable when it comes to higher level gameplay. This would explain why Valkyrie is so commonly seen in Predator ranked lobbies (top 750 players on the platform). </li>

<li> For her tactical ability Missile Swarm, Valk launches 12 missiles in a 4x3 array dealing light damage to enemies with a stun effect upon impact. The first missile does 25 dmg to a single player, any subsequent missiles will hit for 3 dmg each.  </li>

<li> Contrary to popular belief, her tactical is NOT overpowered. In fact, seasoned players would argue that it‚Äôs somewhat underpowered. The range of the ability should be increased, and the missiles could benefit from a more tuned trajectory path. </li>

<li> Despite her fiery, rambunctious attitude, Valkyrie is quite sincere at heart. This is evident from her ‚ÄúOh so sorry!‚Äù voice line, displaying her apologetic and thoughtful nature. </li>

<li> Unique voice lines can be heard between Valkyrie and other legends, most notably Loba and Bangalore. Said voice lines hint at a potential love triangle, which is crazy considering they are all literally competing against each other in a blood-sport. </li>

     </ul>
